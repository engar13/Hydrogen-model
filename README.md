# Hydrogen-model
Heatmap of the Hydrogen electron probability distribution given by the wavefunction for states 
```math
(n,l,m)\in\{ (1,0,0); \;(2,1,0); \;(4,1,0); \;(4,2,0)\} 
```
The wavefunctions are written by hand and not computed by the program itself, since they are involved expressions and 
this program is focused only on the heatmap generation, not the derivation of the equations themselves.

There is one file for each wavefunction and the color of the heatmap can be changed within the code.

**To Summarize:**
## Content:
- 4 `.py` Python code files for 4 separate python programms, one for each Hydrogen mode.
- 1 `.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file for 1 Jupyter Notebook including all code.
